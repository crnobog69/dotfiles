📌 I am currently using the [Text theme](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes/tree/master/text) with the Catppuccin Mocha variant. (there is no option to import/export config files)

🪐 You can use [*my script*](https://github.com/crnobog69/spicetify-bat-installer-autoupdater) to install `Spicetify` for `Windows`.
